# XYZ-Analysis
Company XYZ is an online video streaming company like YouTube or Dailymotion.
I needed to perform data analysis for two tasks:

1.	Classify each video into one of these 3 categories:

○ "Top" - the most likely to watch videos

○ "Good" - 2nd most likelihood to watch videos

○ "Everything else" - the lowest likelihood

2.	 What are the main characteristics of "top videos"?  After identifying the hot videos' characteristics, how would you use this information from a product standpoint?
